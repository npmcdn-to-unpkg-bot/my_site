Hello again, World!

This is the second post on my new blog! In this post, I'll briefly talk about who I am and what I'm doing.

### Meet Rich Cordero!
My name is Rich Cordero, Dr. Rich Cordero. In 2015, after nine long years, I received my PhD in Philosophy from Florida State University. I am currently making the move from academia to the field of JavaScript and Web Development.

For the past year, I've been an adjunct professor of philosophy at Tallahassee Community College but for medical reasons am no longer able to continue in that role. So I'm teaching myself JavaScript and web development with the aim, ultimately, of securing (ideally) remote employment as a developer.

On this blog, for the most part, I will be writing about my experience learning the dark arts of web development. My main focus for now, as far as I can tell, is going to be on JavaScript. I'd like to get a handle on JS itself before branching out and looking at some of the more popular frameworks like Angular, React (I'm really looking forward to sinking my teeth into [this](http://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react/) by [Brian Holt](https://twitter.com/holtbt)), Ember, etc.

I also might be talking about my experiences as a person with a disability (PWD). I require the use of mobility aids to get around (full-leg prosthesis (L) and one-point walking stick) and suffer from chronic pain because of scoliosis. This makes life difficult, to say the least. I hope that by talking about it, it'll prove cathartic for me and perhaps, just maybe, it'll let someone else know that they're not alone in their struggles.
