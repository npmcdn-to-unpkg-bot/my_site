Hello World!

This is the first post on my new blog. I built this site in large part (i.e. almost completely) by following along with [Travis Nielson of DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KeBN2krBtcO3U90_7SOl-A)'s series "Design+Code My Personal Site in 12 Hours". If you're interested in Web Development, I highly recommend the DevTips channel. It's great.

At the time of writing, this site is not actually live. I'm building it now, and once it's a little more presentable, I'll upload it to the web. Until then, enjoy not knowing I exist!
